## Bio
Software engineer since 1998. Abducted by the java world I was alway looking for new challenges and new technologies. Thatâ€™s how I finally discovered Node.js and, in particular Meteor. I work in the R&D department at Atos in many european projects focused on fostering the innovation and the creativity within the SMEs (Small & Medium Enterprises).

#### Talk: Rapid prototyping with Meteor
An introduction to Meteor, a Node.js based framework which is a very simple environment for building web applications. The Meteor framework runs half in the server (node.js) and half in the client, very flexible in the project organization and with one principle: only data in the wire.
