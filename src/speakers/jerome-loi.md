Every one needs some inspiration, some motivation, for Jérôme, it was his cats. Nearly two years ago, an idea spawned and lead him to node and arduinos, he now had build a lab and returned to the arcane of physics pursuing his quest for a breakthru in cat devices

#### Workshop: Catbot workshop

A step by step guide to building your own internet controllable laser turret and cat dazzler... This workshop will teach you how to control an arduino micro controller and link it to the internet using node, serial communication and websockets. We will be using the nodeschool.io workshoper we made with the fine lads @NodeBotsUK


Note: this workshop may require a full gcc chain and python 2.7 if you want to attend please download them beforehand to avoid spending the workshop downloading xCode.
