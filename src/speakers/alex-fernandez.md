## Bio
Alex Fernández is a Spanish software engineer with 15+ years of experience.

Shameless tinkerer since forever, he was seduced by node.js a couple of years ago, and now eats thousands of requests per second for breakfast.

## Talk: Scalability Lessons: Beyond 50k requests per second
For a startup with limited resources, scaling beyond 50K requests per second presents some unique technical challenges. In this talk I review some of what our team has learned while scaling our platform to twelve countries, tens of servers, and several billion requests per month. Along the way we will see what node.js has to offer for scaling, explore some architectures especially well suited for the cloud, and try to grasp the zen of scalability.
