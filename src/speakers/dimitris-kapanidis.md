#### Talk: Continuous Delivery of Node.js Apps with Docker from Scratch to Production
So you started with the MEAN stack your development, but how do you deploy to production and tackle the challenges of continuously deliver your application?

In this talk we'll explain how DEV and PRO are different in terms of needs and we'll use docker as a container engine to build an immutable environment for our MEAN app.

We'll see how to use continuous delivery pipeline to separate build, test and deploy phases. We'll talk about how to achieve the holy grail of continuous delivery: one-click deploys with zero downtime.

But still we need to prepare ourselves for the worst, when disaster come we need to have verified backups to restore the system in seconds.

We'll see all this in real-life example here at http://harbur.io/
