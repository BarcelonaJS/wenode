#### Talk: Property-based testing - another nail in TDD's coffin?

Property-based testing - another nail in TDD's coffin? In spring 2014, David Heinemeier Hansson sparked an intense debate about our industries' testing culture with a provocative statement: "TDD is dead". Whether you agree with this or not, it might be a good reason to look at alternative approaches to testing. This talk discusses property-based testing, a method which promises to greatly reduce the time spent on writing tests by generating the test cases for you. We will discuss the theory, advantages and problems and take a look at how to use it to test JavaScript code. After this session you will have a new tool under your belt which might prevent quite a few bugs in the future.
