#### Talk: NodeJS in the NoSQL World

In many NodeJS applications one or even several (NoSQL-) databases are in use. In this talk you will get a short overview on how to connect to the different systems and get all the benefits of polyglot persistence into your NodeJS application. However there are also some challenges awaiting:
